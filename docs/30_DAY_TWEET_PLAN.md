# 30-Day X (Twitter) Tweet Plan — Raise The OpenClaw

## Goal

- **Wonder:** Make people stop scrolling — "What if I could run a mesh of AI agents?" / "CEO + Sec on Mac Mini + NAS?"
- **Traffic:** Clicks to [README](../README.md), [GETTING_STARTED.md](../GETTING_STARTED.md), Mission Control, and [clawdocs.org](https://clawdocs.org).

## Audience

- Devs and tinkerers interested in **autonomous AI agents**, **multi-agent systems**, **local/self-hosted AI**
- People searching for **OpenClaw**, **agent mesh**, **CEO-style orchestrators**, **NAS + AI**
- OSS and **documentation-first** / reference-implementation fans

## Content Pillars (rotate across 30 days)

| Pillar                 | Angle                                | Example hook                                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Wonder / "What if"** | One line that reframes the possible  | "What if your AI had a CEO and an executive assistant on different machines?" |
| **How / Setup**        | Concrete, low-friction               | "Mission Control in the browser. No npm install."                             |
| **Architecture**       | Mesh, bridge, federation             | "Two nodes. One bridge. Shared memory and skills."                            |
| **Open / Docs**        | Transparency, copy-paste, no lock-in | "PRD + runnable code. No protocol change required."                           |
| **Teaser / Design**    | Future or design-only                | "Army of OpenClaw: chain of command, ranks, orders."                          |

## 30-Day Calendar (themes and post types)

- **Days 1–7:** Intro + wonder. Lead with one striking idea; link repo or GETTING_STARTED.
- **Days 8–14:** How it works. Mission Control, mesh, bridge, CEO+Sec; one concept per tweet.
- **Days 15–21:** Deep dives. Federation hub, shared store, sync, security/observability.
- **Days 22–28:** Use cases + "what you can build." NAS+Mac Mini, intel share, Army design.
- **Days 29–30:** Recap + CTA. "30 days of Raise The OpenClaw" + single clear link.

**Post rhythm:** 1 tweet per day (or 5–6/week if you prefer). Optional: 1 thread in week 2 or 3 ("How we run a mesh of OpenClaw agents in 5 steps").

## Traffic and engagement tips

- **Link once per tweet** — repo root, GETTING_STARTED, or a specific doc/section (Mission Control, PRD, federation hub).
- **@mentions:** Tag **@OpenClaw** (confirm handle on X if different) so the project sees and can amplify. Optional: tag dev/OSS accounts that care about agent frameworks or self-hosted AI.
- **Hashtags (sparing):** e.g. `#OpenClaw` `#AIagents` `#opensource` `#selfhosted` `#LocalAI` — 1–2 per tweet to avoid noise.
- **CTAs:** "→ Raise The OpenClaw", "Get started:", "Docs:", "Repo:".
- **Mention** [clawdocs.org](https://clawdocs.org) or "OpenClaw" when relevant so the main project gets discovery.
- **Thread (optional):** One 5–7 tweet thread in the month: "How we run a mesh of OpenClaw agents (CEO + Sec, Mac Mini + Synology) in 5 steps" with a step per tweet and final CTA to GETTING_STARTED.
